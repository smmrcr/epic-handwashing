             <p><strong>EPIC HAND WASHING IN A TIME OF LOST NARRATIVES</strong> is an iteration on the project <em>A Kitchen of One's Own,</em> created for the media wall in the Photographer's Gallery (London). This iteration of the project displays a set of 74 videos <a href="http://www.bit.ly/epic-hand-washing">from the EPIC KITCHENS dataset</a> that were trained for machine learning with the verb &ldquo;wash&rdquo; and the paired noun &ldquo;hand.&rdquo; This speculative remix juxtaposes <a href="http://www.bit.ly/epic-hand-washing-bibliography">a dataset of texts</a> curated by the authorsâ€”selections of quotes from literature written during or about pandemics such as the bubonic plague and the global influenza pandemic of 1918-19. <br /><br /> If you would like to suggest a quote, <a href="https://forms.gle/vaiww2pFfwqkvYtZA">fill out this form.</a> This project was made by <a href="http://missconceptions.net/">xtine burrough</a> and <a href="http://www.visiblewomen.net/projects.html">Sabrina Starnaman</a> with technical direction provided by <a href="https://atec.utdallas.edu/content/macdonald-dale/?portfolioCats=111,110,112">Dale MacDonald.</a> It was developed for the web to showcase on The Photographer's Gallery site.
